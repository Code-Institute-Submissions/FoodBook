## Strategy

I wanted to answer users common questions such as "Is this what I expected to see?", "Does it offer what I want?",
"Is it valuable enough for me to return?". 
For this website I aimed to create an user friendly, intiuitive structure. To do that I tried to create simple but visually appealing website

## Scope

This website scope are those people who is looking for different tastes from the world's cuisine. 


## Structure

The website is build in one page and three sections landing, interactive section and contact form section.  
The landing section has the header navigation section is placed at the top of the page along with the logo and fixed, will follow the user through the page.  
I used tree structure therefore the menu on the mobile version collapses to the "hamburger" icon made with bootstrap classes. There is a short looped video
with animated box greets the user as they arrive the website.
Next section gives brief information about what the website offer how to use it.
"Find restaurant" tab will take you the main interaction of the website.I wanted to make it clear by light opacity and pointer cursor to find the restaurants
you need to click one of the cuisine.
As you click markers of the restaurants will appear with in range of your location on the map. When you click the marker of the restaurant you choose it will
bring card of an information photo, address, rating, webstie and reviews.
"Contact me" section has give some information about me and contact form if the user fills in and send a message I will recieve immediately.
Footer has the social links colors and layout suited the rest of the website.  


## Skeleton

I tried to give as many information as I can with minimum choices. Navigation has "home", "find restaurant", "contact me" section.  
The website prototype I have designed is [here](wireframe/FoodBook Wireframe.pdf).  
## Surface

The colors I used in this project are #b45008 , #e8bf65 and whitesmoke.
I used Google fonts for the website; font "Courgette" for the section titles and logo, font "Raleway" for the main content.
